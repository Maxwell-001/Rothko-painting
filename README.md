# Rothko Painting 
Welcome to my Rothko painting recreation project! This project is my attempt to recreate a famous Rothko painting using only HTML and CSS. It's a learning exercise aimed at understanding colors, gradients, and the artistic style of Mark Rothko.

## Features:
#### HTML and CSS: 
The entire Rothko painting is created using only HTML elements and CSS styles. No JavaScript or external libraries were used.
#### CSS Gradients: 
I've utilized CSS gradients to recreate the color blocks and gradients characteristic of Rothko's paintings.
#### Creative Expression: 
While I'm a beginner, I've tried to capture the essence and emotion of Rothko's artwork, experimenting with color combinations and gradients.
#### Learning Opportunity: 
Through building this project, I've gained hands-on experience with CSS gradients, color theory, and the use of negative space in design.
## Usage:
#### Clone the Repository: 
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone <repository-url>
#### Open in Browser: 
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the Rothko painting recreation.

#### Explore: 
Take a moment to observe the colors and gradients in the painting, and appreciate the simplicity and depth of Rothko's style.

#### Learn: 
Within the CSS file, I've left comments to explain my thought process and the techniques I've used to recreate the painting. Feel free to read through and learn from my experience!

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas for enhancing the painting's design, or if you spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
